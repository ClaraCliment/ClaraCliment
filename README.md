# **Clara Climent**
## *Junior front-end web developer & Senior graphic designer*
Hi! My name is Clara and I am currently following a training as a web developer junior at [BeCode](https://becode.org/fr/apprendre/developpeur-web-junior/), in Brussels. I have been working as a graphic designer these last 12 years and I would like to join a digital team after my training and deepen my knowledge in web development. 

### My skills
* My passion for design (print and digital) and my creativity
* My past experience in advertising 
* I am a teamplayer

### What I like
* Creative and design stuff!! It could be an art exhibition, a comic book, ...
* DIY activities: in other words, creating with my own hands (sewing, jewelry making, drawing, knitting, ...)
* Reading and watching stories (movies, books, tv shows, illustrations, ...)

### The objectives I would like to achieve as a developer during my training at Becode.
I would like to be able to create a web site or an app and deeply understand how every part of it works and communicates with each other. 

### I look forward to...
Coding everyday and seeing the evolution.

### Working as a team, I really value:
1. Sharing and learning from each other
2. Communication 
3. A good laugh !
